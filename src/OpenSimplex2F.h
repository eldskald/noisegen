/**
 * K.jpg's OpenSimplex 2, faster variant
 *
 * - 2D is standard simplex implemented using a lookup table.
 * - 3D is "Re-oriented 4-point BCC noise" which constructs a
 *   congruent BCC lattice in a much different way than usual.
 * - 4D constructs the lattice as a union of five copies of its
 *   reciprocal. It successively finds the closest point on each.
 *
 * Multiple versions of each function are provided. See the
 * documentation above each, for more info.
 *
 * Ported from Java to C by Stephen M. Cameron
